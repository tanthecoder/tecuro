### Te Curo Static Website – Technical Plan (0001)

#### Context
Build a static marketing website to showcase the skincare business described in `Te Curo.txt`. Incorporate the brand’s verbatim identity and purpose:
- "Te Curo"; Meaning: "I take care of you"; "EST. 2025"; tagline: "HEALED BY NATURE".
- Target audience: "13-30 years old".
- Positioning: Natural skincare that is not: "Cancerogenic", "Causes allergies (Fragrances)", "Endocrine disruptor", "Hard drugs (birth control pill, Accutane)", "Unknown ingredients".
- Purpose: "Create a skincare brand that is organic, using all natural ingredients", "Nourishing and healing skin", "Ingredient transparency".
- Product scope: Skincare line, body skincare, haircare, soaps. Future: SPF, Makeup products.
- Ingredients to highlight: tamanu oil, aloe vera, propolis, beeswax, jojoba oil, shea butter, tea tree oil, green tea.
- Product suits vibes: "Earthy, dewy, gold, nostalgic"; "Nostalgic, rosy, lover"; "Cool, freeing, breezy, fresh".
- Pain points: Acne prone skin, Hormonal acne, Sensitive skin, Keratosis Pilaris, Overwhelmed by ingredients, Feeling hopeless.
- Want points: Simple yet powerful skincare, Transparent/Trustworthy ingredients, A healing ritual.

This plan uses a no-backend, static approach (HTML/CSS/JS), with optional lightweight data files for content.

#### Site Map and Page Responsibilities
- `index.html` (Home)
  - Above-the-fold hero: "HEALED BY NATURE", "EST. 2025", CTA to Products and Ingredients.
  - Brand pillars (organic, 100% naturally derived, ethically sourced, no fragrances/alcohols/synthetic preservatives).
  - Featured products (static cards) and links to Education/Ingredients.
- `about.html` (About/Brand Story)
  - "Te Curo — I take care of you"; Purpose; Target audience: 13–30.
  - Pain points and Want points sections.
  - Brand vibes translated into colors/typography and imagery guidelines.
- `products.html` (Catalog – static dataset for now)
  - Grid of product cards; filters by concern (Acne, Hormonal acne, Sensitive skin, Keratosis Pilaris) and key traits (Fragrance-free, Alcohol-free, Synthetic-preservative-free).
  - Sort (Popularity placeholder / Alphabetical).
- `ingredients.html` (Ingredient Transparency / Glossary)
  - Searchable list of ingredients (tamanu oil, aloe vera, etc.) with benefits, sourcing, and whether to avoid for common sensitivities.
  - Detail modal/accordion per ingredient.
- `education.html` (Learn)
  - Static articles/cards on ingredient education; links to glossary entries.
- `contact.html` (Contact/Newsletter)
  - Email capture (static form post to a provider); social links/placeholders.
- `legal/privacy.html`, `legal/terms.html`
  - Simple static legal pages.

Optional future (scaffold only, empty for now):
- `future/workout.html`, `future/diet.html`, `future/habits.html` (align with "Workout / Diet / Habits" references in `Te Curo.txt`).

#### Files and Directories to Create
Create a new top-level `website/` folder (keeps site isolated from docs):

- `website/index.html`
- `website/about.html`
- `website/products.html`
- `website/ingredients.html`
- `website/education.html`
- `website/contact.html`
- `website/legal/privacy.html`
- `website/legal/terms.html`
- `website/future/workout.html`
- `website/future/diet.html`
- `website/future/habits.html`
- `website/assets/styles/base.css` (reset, typography, layout)
- `website/assets/styles/theme.css` (color tokens reflecting "Earthy, dewy, gold, nostalgic" etc; light/dark optional)
- `website/assets/styles/components.css` (cards, buttons, nav, accordion)
- `website/assets/scripts/main.js` (init, navigation, theme)
- `website/assets/scripts/products.js` (filters/sorting/render)
- `website/assets/scripts/ingredients.js` (search/index/render)
- `website/assets/scripts/forms.js` (newsletter/contact validation)
- `website/assets/data/products.json` (static product stubs)
- `website/assets/data/ingredients.json` (ingredient glossary data)
- `website/assets/images/` (brand and product imagery placeholders)
- `website/site.webmanifest`
- `website/favicon.ico`
- `website/robots.txt`
- `website/sitemap.xml` (static; update when adding pages)

Note: If we later choose a static site generator (e.g., Eleventy/Astro), these files map to layouts/pages/partials; for now they remain plain static assets.

#### Data Layer (Phase 1)
Define content structures (no code here; implement as JSON):
- Product fields: id, name, category (face/body/hair/soap), concerns (acne/hormonal/sensitive/kp), traits (fragranceFree/alcoholFree/syntheticPreservativeFree), heroImage, shortDescription, keyIngredients (array of ingredient ids), link (detail page or external), availability (inStock/comingSoon).
- Ingredient fields: id, name, aliases, description (benefits), sources, caution (who should avoid), tags (e.g., anti-inflammatory, antioxidant), references (urls for education), isCommonAllergen (bool), isEndocrineDisruptor (bool; default false per brand stance).

Content sources:
- Seed `ingredients.json` with: tamanu oil, aloe vera, propolis, beeswax, jojoba oil, shea butter, tea tree oil, green tea (verbatim from `Te Curo.txt`).
- Seed `products.json` with placeholder products that reference these ingredients and target the listed concerns.

#### UI Structure and Components (Phase 2A – Static Markup)
- Global header/navigation: logo, links (Home, Products, Ingredients, Education, About, Contact); mobile menu toggle.
- Hero component: headline "HEALED BY NATURE", subtext, CTA buttons.
- Card components: product card (image, name, traits badges), article card, ingredient card.
- Filter controls: checkboxes/toggles for concerns and traits; select for sort.
- Accordion/Modal: ingredient details.
- Footer: brand meaning "I take care of you", social links, legal links.

Accessibility:
- Semantic landmarks (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`), keyboard navigability, focus styles, ARIA roles for menu/accordion, color contrast for the stated vibes.

#### Behavior (Phase 2B – JS Interactivity)
Functions to implement (names only; no code):
- Navigation and theming
  - `initializeNavigation()`
  - `handleMobileMenuToggle()`
  - `applyPreferredTheme()`
- Products
  - `loadProductsData()`
  - `filterProducts(selectedConcerns, selectedTraits)`
  - `sortProducts(products, sortKey)`
  - `renderProductGrid(container, products)`
  - `syncFiltersWithQueryParams()`
- Ingredients
  - `loadIngredientsData()`
  - `searchIngredients(query, index)`
  - `buildIngredientIndex(ingredients)`
  - `renderIngredientList(container, items)`
  - `toggleIngredientDetails(id)`
- Forms
  - `validateEmail(value)`
  - `handleNewsletterSubmit(event)`

---

#### Algorithms (Step-by-Step)
1) Product Filtering and Sorting
- Read `products.json`.
- Build an in-memory array of products.
- On filter change: derive `selectedConcerns` and `selectedTraits` from UI.
- Filter predicate: include a product if it matches at least one selected concern (OR) and satisfies all selected traits (AND). If no filters selected, show all.
- Apply sorting: if `Alphabetical`, sort by name ascending; if `Popularity` (placeholder), default to name until real metric exists.
- Render grid; update URL query parameters to reflect filters/sort; on load, parse query to restore state.

2) Ingredient Search (Debounced, Simple Index)
- Read `ingredients.json`.
- Build a lowercase keyword index from: name, aliases, tags.
- On input change: wait for 200ms (debounce) then split query into tokens.
- Score each ingredient by token presence in fields (name > aliases > tags weight).
- Return top N matches; render list; highlight matched tokens.

3) Newsletter Form Validation
- On submit, prevent default; validate email format and non-empty consent checkbox if present.
- If valid: either
  - POST to a static form service endpoint (e.g., Netlify Forms/Formspree) and display success, or
  - Store locally (as a placeholder) and show confirmation.
- If invalid: show inline errors; focus first error.

#### Styling and Theming (Phase 2C)
- Define color tokens reflecting vibes: earthy neutrals + gold accents; secondary palettes for rosy and breezy variants. Ensure WCAG AA contrast.
- Typography: legible sans-serif for body; elegant serif for headings (if chosen). Preload/`preconnect` fonts; provide system fallbacks.
- Layout: responsive grid (mobile-first), container widths, spacing scale.
- Media: use modern formats (WebP/AVIF) with `<img loading="lazy">` and appropriate `sizes/srcset`.

---

#### SEO, Analytics, and Perf
- Per-page `<title>` and meta description; Open Graph/Twitter cards.
- `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`; canonical links; clean URLs.
- Structured data (Organization/Product where applicable) as JSON-LD script blocks.
- Lightweight, privacy-friendly analytics (optional): Plausible/Umami script inclusion.
- Performance: minify CSS/JS (if build step later), defer non-critical JS, inline critical CSS for above-the-fold.

---

#### Deployment
- Host on GitHub Pages or Netlify.
- If GitHub Pages: place site in `website/` and configure Pages to serve from that folder; add `CNAME` if custom domain.
- If Netlify: drag-drop or CI deploy; use Netlify Forms if newsletter capture is desired without a backend.

---

#### Deliverables Checklist
- Static pages: `index.html`, `about.html`, `products.html`, `ingredients.html`, `education.html`, `contact.html`, `legal/*`, `future/*` (empty stubs ok).
- Data files: `assets/data/products.json`, `assets/data/ingredients.json` (seeded with items from `Te Curo.txt`).
- Interactivity: filters, search, form validation wired to the static data and provider endpoint.
- Assets: favicon, manifest, images.
- SEO files: `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`.

#### Open Questions (non-blocking)
- Hosting preference (GitHub Pages vs Netlify) and newsletter provider?
- Final color palette selection among the described vibes; logo/brand assets?
- Initial product list and imagery; any product detail pages needed now?
- Copy approvals for About, Education, and Ingredient descriptions?
